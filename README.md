# Go Error Handling Bug: Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a common error in Go programs: failing to check for errors returned by functions. The `bug.go` file shows a function that can return an error but doesn't always handle it appropriately.  The `bugSolution.go` provides a corrected version.

**Bug:** The `MyFunc` function correctly returns an error if the input `x` is zero, preventing division by zero. However, if `MyFunc` is called, the returned error is not checked, resulting in a silent failure.  If the error isn't handled appropriately, this could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in a larger program.

**Solution:**  The solution involves properly checking the error returned from `MyFunc`. If an error occurs, it should be handled gracefully, for example, by logging it, returning an appropriate error to the caller, or performing some kind of recovery.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling in Go to build robust and reliable applications.
